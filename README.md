Upsilon!
=
So, what is Upsilon? You can say: "Oh, it might be just another programming language, baah, nothing important." But I say to you: "No!! Okay, it's just another programming language, but it's different." How can it be different from others languages? The Upsilon is different because it is not compiled or interpreted, it's Converted.

### What? Converted? Be more specific!
Yeah, it's converted. The Upsilon code, when passing by compiler, is converted to an C++ code, and finally compiled. And, again, you say: "Oh, C++? This language is so powerful..." I did think the same.

### Why do you making this language?
I like to teach a lot of nice guys around. But it's complex for him, because it I'm making this language, just for teaching easy (And for when I be tired to program in C++ (serious)).

### Okay, let's see it
Wow, wait, I'm not finished the Upsilon (though I'm finishin). But I can show you some features.

- It's high-level
Yeah, so easy to program, so natural to read, so beautiful.

- There's simple features that are tiring in C++
In C++ we haven't comprehension lists, there's only vectors and more vectors, for-loops and more for-loops. In Upsilon, the comprehension list is easy and useful.

- Functions and Lambdas are simplified
In C++, the functions and lambda functions are very large and tiring to make such. However, in Upsilon it's so easy than drink water. The way to make functions and lambda functions in Upsilon are simplified too.

- Generic!
Oh yeah, generic programming in C++ is horrible in sense of large codes. In Upsilon, the generic programming is in everywhere! There's no types! Yeah! YEAH! Oh... Sorry, I got excited.

- Simple expressions
Well, the functions' body are simple, not much complex, the language is not for large codes or whatever you think, it's to make good algorithms in the simple and better way.

### Documentation?
... Ok, I'm not finished it too. It coming yet.

## The license
This project is lincensed under GPLv3 license, so you are free to do everything (or almost everything) with my language.
